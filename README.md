# Easy-program-installer
A simple program that allows you to install any program just by writing its name. N.B.: works with windows 11, with 10 and earlier has not been tested

---------------------------------------------------------------------
guidelines:
1) Install the program, it is present in two languages, but they will be increased. The programs are the same, only the language changes
2) Launch the program
3) Choose the option you need

N.B.: In some cases multiple programs are found, they are always the same, but taken from different sources. just copy the ID code of the one you want to install. Those with written "msstore" come directly from the microsoft store, those with written "winget" from the program. It's up to you. I recommend winget

Very very simple here too. You just have to write the name of the program. Do not write anything and press Enter to see the list of updatable programs

N.B.: If there are no updates you will see the error message.
